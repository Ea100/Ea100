# Cyber Security_Capstone_Project
This project demonstrates the practical implementation of cybersecurity concepts learned over the three-month training program.  It entails establishing a fully functional virtual cybersecurity lab as well as conducting a forensic investigation of an Android image with industry-standard tools.  The objective is to replicate real-world circumstances for threat analysis, evidence extraction, and secure network design.

### Project Overview
---
This project explores a retail store's sales data to gain insights into product performance, regional sales, and monthly trends. The analysis began with Excel, using pivot tables and formulas to identify key metrics and sales patterns. SQL queries were then used to uncover additional insights, including product category totals, top customers, and regional contributions. Finally, an interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visually represent the findings, helping to identify high-performing products and trends across different regions.
