### Project Overview
---
This project demonstrates the practical implementation of cybersecurity concepts learned over the three-month training program.  It entails establishing a fully functional virtual cybersecurity lab as well as conducting a forensic investigation of an Android image with industry-standard tools.  The objective is to replicate real-world circumstances for threat analysis, evidence extraction, and secure network design..
